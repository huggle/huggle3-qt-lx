    //! Provides logging to various places

    //! This is a base class of logging subsystem, which provides ability to generate logs into internal Huggle ring log
    //! as well as terminal, both stdout and stderr.
    //! This subsystem support threading and uses own buffer for writing, so it's safe to put massive amount of data into it, although even that may affect performance
    //! in some way, given that the logs you input here will be drawn somewhere, and that is usually CPU expensive.
    //!
    //! Basic usage of this subsystem can be done through various macros, for example:
    //! HUGGLE_LOG("Hello world"); // This will write to standard log
    //! HUGGLE_WARNING("Hey - be careful"); // Orange warning
    //! HUGGLE_ERROR("Something is wrong"); // Red text, goes to stderr
    //! HUGGLE_DEBUG1("Debug with verbosity 1"); // Debug log
    //! HUGGLE_DEBUG("Some text", 5); // Debug with verbosity 5
    //!
    //! Debug logs are only visible if verbosity is same or higher than their level
    //!
    //! There is an instance of this class that can be used to log from external modules using same facility, you can do that using these macros:
    //!
    //! HUGGLE_EXDEBUG("Some text", verbosity);
    //! HUGGLE_EXDEBUG1("Hi");
    //!
    //! These macros are only available within extension scope.
    //!
    //! Primary instance of this class, if you can't use macros, can be accessed through pointer Huggle::Syslog::HuggleLogs
