Building
=========

IMPORTANT: Since 3.1.19 you must download submodules in folder libs using git:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

If you didn't download this repository using git, there should be a guide on where you can download the libraries from in the respective folders.

Libraries and tools you need to have to build:
* C++11 compiler
* [CMake](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake) 2.8.9 or higher is required
* QT4 sdk (libqt4-dev libqt4-webkit libqt4-network qt4-qmake libqtwebkit-dev libqt4-dev-bin qt4-dev-tools)
* (optional) QT5 sdk (libqt5webkit5-dev qt5-default qtquick1-5-dev qtlocation5-dev qtsensors5-dev qtscript5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev)
* (optional) Python (libpython-dev)

Windows
-------------
https://github.com/huggle/huggle3-qt-lx/wiki/Building-on-Windows

Linux
-------------
* checkout this repository
* cd REPO/huggle, execute

```sh
# IMPORTANT
# The --extension option works only if you cloned this repository using git
# if you downloaded a gzip file, you can only use it after downloading them
# by hand into 'huggle/extension_list' folder
./configure --extension --qt4 #you can use --qt5 in case you have it
cd huggle_release
make
sudo make install
```

MacOS
------------

WebKit vs Chromium
-------------------
Qt4 - Qt5.4 supports WebKit, which is a default backend for Huggle. Newer Qt support only Chromium backend (code named WebEngine)

If you want to build huggle with Qt newer than 5.4 you will have to enable it like this:

```
./configure --qt5 --web-engine
```

Or alternatively if you are starting cmake by hand, just pass it `-DWEB_ENGINE=true` parameter

Python
------------
To enable python engine you need to:

On linux / mac:
run ./configure with --python option, for example
```
./configure --qt5 --python
```
Note: you need to have cmake 3.0.0 or newer for this to work

On windows you need to run cmake with -DHUGGLE_PYTHON=TRUE for it to work

Now rebuild Huggle and hope for the best!

If you manage to compile it, you can insert your .py extensions to HUGGLEROOT/extensions, for more
information ask for help on our irc channel.
