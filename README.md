Building
=========

IMPORTANT: Since 3.1.19 you must download submodules in folder libs using git:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

If you did not download this repository using git, there should be a guide on where you can download the libraries from in the respective folders.

Libraries and tools you need to have to build:

* C++11 compiler
* [CMake](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake) 2.8.9 or higher is required
* QT5 or QT6 sdk

[NEW] It is now possible to use a VirtualBox VM as a portable development environment for Huggle. [» Wiki page](https://github.com/huggle/huggle3-qt-lx/wiki/Portable-development-environment)

Windows
-------------

[» Wiki page](https://github.com/huggle/huggle3-qt-lx/wiki/Building-on-Windows)

Linux
-------------

* checkout this repository
* enter the repository folder, then execute:

```sh
# IMPORTANT
# The --extension option works only if you cloned this repository using git
# if you downloaded a gzip file, you can only use it after downloading them
# by hand into 'huggle/extension_list' folder
./configure --extension --web-engine
cd release
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

MacOS
------------

WebKit vs Chromium
-------------------

Qt5.0 - Qt5.4 supports WebKit, which is a default backend for Huggle. Newer Qt only supports Chromium backend (code named WebEngine).

If you want to build Huggle with Qt newer than 5.4, you will have to enable it like this:

```sh
./configure --web-engine
```

Or alternatively if you are starting cmake by hand, just pass it the `-DWEB_ENGINE=true` parameter.
