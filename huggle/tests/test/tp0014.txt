==Regarding edits to [[American Revolutionary War]]==
Thank you for contributing to Wikipedia, 208.68.153.177! However, your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Revolutionary_War&diff=118555542&oldid=118431416 here] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove [[WP:SPAM|spam]] from Wikipedia. If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the link you added, matching rule \bexample\.com, is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia. Please read [[WP:EL|Wikipedia's external links policy]] for more information. If the link was to an image, please read [[WP:IMAGE|Wikipedia's image tutorial]] on how to use a more appropriate method to insert the image into an article. If your link was intended to promote a site you own, are affiliated with, or will make money from inclusion in Wikipedia, please note that inserting spam into Wikipedia is against policy.
