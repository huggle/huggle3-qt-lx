This document is intended for huggle developers, it describes
how the developers should write the source code.

Because huggle is being developed by multiple developers
we need to follow same standard so that the code
is easily readable and isn't a mess.

== C++ code ==

The source code written in C++ is formatted using the Allman
(also known as ISO) style:
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style

Example source code:

//! This function loops Bar times and then return 0
int Foo(int Bar)
{
    while (Bar > 0)
    {
        Bar--;
    }
    return 0;
}

this style has huge advantage that brackets match vertically, so that
you can easily see if starting bracket matches the ending one.
On other hand it consumes more line than, for example K and R style.

=== Spaces ===

There is always an empty line between two functions:

int Bluh()
{
    return 0;
}

int Bleh()
{
    return 2;
}

Wrong:

int Bluh (  ) {
  return 0;
}
int Bleh ( )
{ return 2; }

=== Comments ===

Use them everywhere when you feel they should be used :-) especially
for code that may be hard to understand by others.

Every function and class should be documented according to doxygen
format http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html

Please respect code of others, don't change the code of others without
consulting that with them, there may be specific reasons why something
is written in a way it's written.

=== *pointer == NULL ===

When comparing a pointer to NULL you should always do

if (p != NULL) { ... }

instead of

if (!p) { ... }

because despite the first is longer, it's clear you are working with a pointer,
from second it's not clear what data type it actually is.

=== CamelCase ===

Every variable and function should be named using camel case, for example:

int SomeLocalVariable;
void ThisFunctionDoesALotOfStuff();

IMPORTANT: leading character is capital not lower case

=== Indentations ===

Use 4 spaces, no tabs because different IDE's can handle tabs in different way

=== this->x->bla() vs x->bla() ===

If you are working with local object defined for whole class, use always this->object
so that it's clear on first sight that you aren't working with local object
(local to function) neither static object, it makes it easier to read the code and prevent
conflict with other variables or function with same name defined globally for huggle.

Some IDE's display member variables in different color, but some IDE's don't.
Using "this" can make it clear to anyone who read the code.

Another reason for this, is that if there was ever implemented a global variable
or function with same name, it will likely not collide with your code.

=== Order ===

In every class static functions go on first place, right after them are static variables,
then there is a space and follows constructors, destructor and functions with variables.

Using this order in every class declaration (.h file) will make it easier to find
where certain stuff is. It is recommended to order everything alphabetically too.
